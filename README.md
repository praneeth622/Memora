## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18.0 or higher)
- **npm** (version 8.0 or higher) or **yarn** (version 1.22 or higher)
- **Git** for version control

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd memora-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
   Edit `.env.local` with your configuration (see Environment Variables section below).

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

### Additional Setup (Optional)

- **Type checking**: Run `npm run type-check` to verify TypeScript types
- **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` to check code quality
- **Build**: Run `npm run build` to create a production build

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Backend API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Application Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME="Memora"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION="0.1.0"

# LiveKit Configuration (when backend is ready)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-livekit-server.com
# LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your-api-key
# LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

# Feature Flags
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE=false

# Optional: Analytics and Monitoring
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=your-analytics-id
```

### Environment Variable Descriptions

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`: The URL of your backend API server
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME`: Application name displayed in the UI
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION`: Current version of the application
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE`: Enable additional debugging features

> **Note**: Variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser. Keep sensitive data in server-side only variables.

## 📋 Important Notes

### LiveKit Integration

- **Token Generation**: LiveKit tokens are generated by the backend server, not the frontend
- **Real-time Features**: The application includes a comprehensive `useLiveKit` hook ready for LiveKit integration
- **Placeholder Implementation**: Current messaging uses React state as a placeholder until LiveKit backend is ready
- **Connection Management**: The hook handles connection states, error recovery, and participant management

### Backend Dependencies

- The frontend expects a backend API running on the configured `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`
- Authentication and room management are handled by the backend
- LiveKit room tokens must be provided by the backend for security

### Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES2020 support
- WebRTC support required for real-time features
- Responsive design supports mobile browsers

## 👨‍💻 Development Practices

### TypeScript Implementation

- **Strict Mode**: Full TypeScript strict mode enabled for maximum type safety
- **Interface-First Design**: All components use proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Type Exports**: Shared types are exported from dedicated type files
- **Generic Components**: Reusable components with proper generic typing

### Code Quality Standards

```json
{
  "eslint": "Next.js recommended + custom rules",
  "prettier": "Consistent code formatting",
  "typescript": "Strict mode with comprehensive types"
}
```

### Accessibility Standards

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: All components meet accessibility guidelines
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactive elements
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Focus Management**: Logical focus flow and visible focus indicators
- **Color Contrast**: Meets WCAG contrast requirements in all themes

### Component Architecture

```
components/
├── ui/           # shadcn/ui base components
├── chat/         # Chat-specific components
├── forms/        # Form components
└── layout/       # Layout components
```

### State Management Patterns

- **React Hooks**: useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated logic in reusable hooks
- **Context API**: For global state when needed
- **Local State**: Component-level state for UI interactions

## 🚀 Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run type-check   # Run TypeScript compiler check

# Code Quality
